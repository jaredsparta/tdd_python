# TDD - Test Driven Development

**Types of testing**
- Unit testing
- TDD


**Python**
- Python has several modules that one can use to test one's code:
    1. PyTest
    2. UnitTest

**Why TDD?**
- Allows one to minimise the risk of a product potentially failing when deployed

**Steps**
1. Create a file to write tests
2. Run the test - they will fail
3. Create a file to write code
4. We will refactor and add the code to pass the tests
